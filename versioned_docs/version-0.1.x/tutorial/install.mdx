| `test` | Install the dependencies related to `pytest`. These dependencies are not used by the package but used by the unittests. |
| `dev`  | Install the developer's dependencies. These dependencies may be used for building the package.                          |

## Install the GitHub version

The GitHub version may be newer than the PyPI version during the development.
If users want to install the GitHub version, please ensure that [Git<IconExternalLink/>][link-git] has been installed.
After that, run the following command to install the developer's version.

```shell
git clone -b v0.1.2 --depth 1 --single-branch https://github.com/cainmagi/dash-file-cache
cd dash-file-cache
python -m pip install .[dev]
```

:::tip

If you would like, you can add `-e` option after `pip install` to make the installed package editable. Any modification in the cloned project folder
will take effects when `dash_file_cache` is imported anywhere.

:::

## Run the tests

To verify whether the package is compatible with your device, please clone the project and run the tests:

```shell
git clone -b v0.1.2 --depth 1 --single-branch https://github.com/cainmagi/dash-file-cache
cd dash-file-cache
python -m pip install .[test]
python -m pytest tests
```

The package is only compatible with `python>=3.8`. If you find the package fails to pass the tests, please

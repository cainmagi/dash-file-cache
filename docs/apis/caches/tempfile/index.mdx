<APITopBar type="module" source="caches/tempfile.py" />

The cache implemented by temporary directories. Since the data is maintained as files,
currently, the implementation in this module can be only used for caching the file-like
objects. The cached files are stored in a temorary directory and can be accessed by
any programs as long as the files do not reach the end of life.

Note that this module is totally implemented by the Python Standard Library (PySTL).
It has some limitations. For example,

1. All files will not be deleted until the program exit. The temporary folder is
   removed only at the exit of the main process.
2. During the running of the program, the files will not be deleted even if they are
   manually marked as end-of-life. These files are simply truncated as empty files.
